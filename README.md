# NaturalEarthDownloader

The NaturalEarthDownload gem is a command line interface to download files from [Natural Earth Data](https://www.naturalearthdata.com). Natural Earth Data provides vector and raster files with well integrated and maintained catographic attributes to facilitate efficient map production. This gem attempts to provide an equally efficient way to download collections of that data.

## Usage

Clone the repository locally and `cd` into the directory. Run `bin/setup` or `bundle install` to install dependencies with bundler.

Run `bin/NEDL` to start NaturalEarthDownloader and follow the prompts to view files, add them to a download queue, and download the items in your queue to a local folder.  

## Development

After checking out the repo, run `bin/setup` to install dependencies. You can also run `bin/console` for an interactive prompt that will allow you to experiment.

To install this gem onto your local machine, run `bundle exec rake install`. To release a new version, update the version number in `version.rb`, and then run `bundle exec rake release`, which will create a git tag for the version, push git commits and tags, and push the `.gem` file to [rubygems.org](https://rubygems.org).
